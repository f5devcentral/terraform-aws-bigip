# New VPC with a 1-nic BIG-IP in each AZ
This examples deploys a new VPC with subnets across 2 availability zones.  It also builds a 1-nic BIG-IP in each availability zone.

**Note:** This example creates a random, temporary password for the BIG-IP which is stored in the Terraform state file.  This is not a good practice for production environments.  Ideally, you would use a random password generated by the AWS Secrets Manager.

## Usage
To run this example run the following commands:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve 
```

**Note:** this examples deploys resources that will cost money.  Please run the following command to destroy your environment when finished:
```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```
