# New VPC with a 4-nic BIG-IP in each AZ
This examples deploys a new VPC with subnets across 2 availability zones.  It also builds a 4-nic BIG-IP in each availability zone.

**Note:** This example creates a random, temporary password for the BIG-IP which is stored in the Terraform state file.  This is not a good practice for production environments.  Ideally, you would use a random password generated by the AWS Secrets Manager.

## Usage
To test different BIG-IP deployments, this code uses Terraform Workspaces.  
It currently supports the following workspaces:
 - default (this is the 1nic deployment)
 - 2nic
 - 3nic
 - 4nic
 - 8nic

To run this example run the following commands:
```bash
terraform workspace new 2nic
terraform workspace select 2nic
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve 
```

**Note:** this examples deploys resources that will cost money.  Please run the following command to destroy your environment when finished:
```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```
